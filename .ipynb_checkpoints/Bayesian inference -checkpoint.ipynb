    "Bayesian inference is a method of statistical inference that is based on the principles of Bayesian probability. In Bayesian inference, we start with a prior distribution over the possible values of the parameters of a model, and then use data to update this distribution and obtain a posterior distribution. This allows us to incorporate our prior knowledge about the model into our inference process and make more informed predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use Bayesian inference for machine learning, we can follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "Define the model and its parameters: First, we need to define the model that we want to use and specify the parameters that we want to infer. For example, we might define a linear regression model with coefficients w and an intercept b.\n",
    "\n",
    "Choose a prior distribution: Next, we need to specify a prior distribution over the model parameters. This distribution represents our prior knowledge about the likely values of the parameters. For example, we might choose a normal distribution with mean 0 and a certain variance for each parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Collect data: Next, we need to collect data that we can use to update our prior distribution. This data should be representative of the problem we are trying to solve and should be sufficient to accurately estimate the model parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Compute the posterior distribution: Once we have collected the data, we can use Bayes' theorem to compute the posterior distribution over the model parameters. This distribution represents our updated belief about the likely values of the parameters given the data we have collected.\n",
    "\n",
    "Make predictions: Finally, we can use the posterior distribution to make predictions about future observations. For example, we might compute the mean and standard deviation of the posterior distribution and use these values to generate a prediction interval for a new observation.\n",
