# Python Notebooks

Interactive Notebook on topics that are useful in Computer Science applications.

## Merkle Trees
    
    A playground for Merkle Trees, with ascii visualisation using a crc8 function for hashes.  
    Merkel trees allows the grouping of hashes, and for a means of proof of membership.  

## Digital Signal Processing DSP

    IIR digital signal processing class, along with a simple steady state detection (SSD) function and a peak detection function. With a matplot function to animate the signal processing.

## PID Controller

    A implimentation of a PID controller, with graphical representations of the PID controller in opperation.

    A PID controler utilises a feedback loop to correct an output signal to meet a target value.
